## Project Scope
- **Objective:** Create a chat system with PowerShell clients and a Linode server.
- **Technologies:** PowerShell, Linux server, optional database, and web server technology.
- **Security:** Implement SSL/TLS for secure communication.

## Linode Server Setup
1. **Select a Linode Plan:** Choose a plan that fits the project needs.
2. **Install Linux:** Set up a Linux distribution like Ubuntu.
3. **Security Measures:** Configure firewalls and SSH keys.
4. **Install Software:** Install necessary software like Apache, Node.js, or Python.

## Chat System Architecture
- **Model:** Use a client-server model for message handling.
- **Protocol:** Choose a communication protocol (e.g., HTTP, WebSocket).

## Server-side Application Development
1. **Backend Logic:** Write a script to handle and broadcast messages.
2. **Database Setup (Optional):** Configure a database to store chat records.

## PowerShell Client Development
1. **Scripting:** Develop scripts for sending and receiving messages.
2. **Interface:** Create a text-based interface in PowerShell.

## Implementing Communication
- **Sending Messages:** Code the functionality to send messages to the server.
- **Receiving Messages:** Implement a method to receive new messages, like polling.

## Testing
1. **Local Network Testing:** Begin testing on a local network.
2. **Linode Server Testing:** Progress to testing with the Linode server.

## Security and Reliability
- **Secure Data Transmission:** Implement SSL/TLS.
- **Error Handling:** Add comprehensive error handling and logging.

## Documentation and Cleanup
- **User Guide:** Write documentation on how to use the chat system.
- **Code Refinement:** Refine and comment the code for better clarity.

## Future Enhancements
- **Additional Features:** Consider private messaging, user authentication, or multiple chat rooms.
- **Performance Optimization:** Focus on server performance and scalability.
